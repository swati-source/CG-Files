considering that we have n no of pods running in frontend, backend, or database etc..
the frontend needs to communicate with backend and backend has to communicate wit database
the pod has a ip address assigned to them, but these are not static and go down at point
of time and when replicaset is configured on nodes the replicaset will create new pods
at the time of pod failure so everytime when pods gets created new ips will be created
so becomes diff to remember pod ip each and every time to connect to application
so we cannot rely on ip address for internal communication btwn applications
          service helps us to group these pods and provide a single interface to access
the pods in group eg: a service created front-end pods will help group together and provide
a single interface for other pods to access a service.
service provides virtual ip to Rs this ip gets mapped to pods ip in the node
nodeport(30000-32,767) it works on top of cluster ip 
 we map the port no to virtual ip...node will be connected to virtual ip 
whenever we want to access the node/pod application we access through port no 
as this port no goes and mapped to virtual ip, as virtual ip will be connected to node ip address where
where pod container will be running and we can access the application through internet.
