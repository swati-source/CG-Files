we probably involve doing lot of repatitive tasks in our environment weather it might be creating vm's
everyday configuration on them,patching,migration,deploying application or performing security &audits
all of these repitative tasks involve execution of 100's of commands 100's on diff servers, and
mantaining them, so to simplify this we have scripts to automate this tasks ana lot of times to put
these scripts together we require Ansible 
lets take a simple use case
imagine that we have lots of servers some are web and some are database svrs ao we would like to
power down or up the webservers or want do configuration changes/ modifying them, installing applications on them 
firewall rules etc..so to do this we can write Ansible playbook to reduce manual work which has 
lots of module available in ansible that supports these kind of operations

there are some inventory parameters in ansible 
ansible_host - use to specify the ip address of the servers
ansible_connection - defines how ansible connects to the target svr weather ssh/winrm/localhost
                                                                    (not connect to remote host)
ansible_port - defines which port tot connect to, by default it is set port 22 to ssh
ansible_user - defines user used to make the remote conncetions by default it root for linux machines
ansible_ssh_pass- set a passwd                    
  
Ansible is an open-source, cross-platform tool for resource provisioning automation 
that DevOps professionals popularly use for continuous delivery of software code by taking 
advantage of an “infrastructure as code” approach.
Ansible can be used to provision the underlying infrastructure of your environment, 
virtualized hosts and hypervisors, network devices, and bare metal servers.
It can also install services, add compute hosts, and provision resources, services, and applications
inside cloud.
with only few lines of instruction in an ansible playbook
YAML is a digestible data serialization language often used to create configuration files with any programming 
language. Designed for human interaction, it can do everything that JSON can and more
