adhoc commands- kind of a linux comands (No idem potency) executes instructions each and every time 
it overites or repeats everytime...we use this when we wnat to create or change configuration on
100 1000's of nodes ...it perform quick functions for a small works.
 uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes
adhoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable

Playbook Playbook is a blueprint of automation tasksâ€”which are complex IT actions executed with
 limited or no human involvement. Ansible Playbooks are executed on a set, group, or
 classification of hosts, which together make up an Ansible inventory
basically its like a file where we can write a codes which consists of vars,taks,handlers,template
 & roles. 
each playbook is composed of 1 or more module -----is collection of configuration files
playbook is divided into many sessions
target section---which defines the host and all
variable------defines variables
tasks section-----has list of modules that need to run in an order.
handler -------to start or restart the servers 
roles------for organizing the task into directiory structure.
