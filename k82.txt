kubernetes services provides communication  betwen various componets
 within or outside of the appliactions, helps us to connect the application
together with other appliactions or users
suppose we have appliaction which has groups of pods one for  serving frontend
 other for backend and other for database so these services enable the connetivity 
between these pods.

it enables frontend appliacton to made available to end users, it helps communication
between backend and frontend pods and thus establish connectivity between database

Nodeport - basically its like an object replication controller,deploynment as we seen it
it listen to the port in the node and forward the request of that port  
on the pod to listen to a appplication
 helps us make an external facing appliaction available on the port on worker nodes

clusterip- service creates the virtual ip inside the cluster to enable the communication
diff services such as frontend and backend servers.
 
loadbalancer- distribute the load accross the webservers in front end tier
