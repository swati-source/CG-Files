(Replication controller) we use coz of load balancing and scaling the containers
 if pod gets deleted or failed it cans deploy another pod, nodespods within the nodes 
an scales when the demands increses 
 it makes sure that desired=current

(deployment)if we want to deploy our webserver to the production env, whenever 
newer version of the application build becomes available on docker registery,
we would like to update our instance, so however if we want to update the instances we 
cannot upgrade all at a time coz users will be accessing the application so we upgrade
one after the other this is known as rollin upgrades.
   suppose one of the upgrades resulted in an error and if we are asked to do undo 
the recent changes we can roll back to the recent changes.
    if we are doing multiple changes to the env such as upgrading underline hardware,
 modifying the resources etc .. we pause the env and make changes and then run so 
all the changes are rolled out together 

provides ability to upgrade the underlined instance using rolling updates, changes 
and pausing whenever required (take down older version and brings up the newer version)
